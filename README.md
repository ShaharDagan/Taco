# Hyper parameters
Before proceeding, please set the pattern, inference, and checkpoint paths in 'Hyper_Parameter.json' according to your environment.



* Sound
    * Setting basic sound parameters.

* Token_JSON_Path
    * Setting the text token

* GST
    * Setting the global style token modules.
    * If 'Use' is false, model does not use GST. It become just tacotron 2.
    * In 'Reference_Encoder/Conv', 'Filters', 'Kernel_Size', and 'Strides' must be lists of the same size.
    * In 'Style_Token/Attention', 'Size' must be divied by 'Head'.

* Tacotron1
    * Setting the parameters of tacotron 1.
    * If 'Taco_Version' is 2, the parameters of this part will be ignored.
    * I recommend that all 'Zoneout' parameters are set 0.0 because the CuDNN does not support the recurrent_dropout yet. See the following reference.
        * https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM
    * Currently, this hyper parameter is ignored because tacotron 1 does not implemented.

* Tacotron2
    * Setting the parameters of tacotron 2.
    * If 'Taco_Version' is 1, the parameters of this part will be ignored.
    * I recommend that all 'Zoneout' parameters are set 0.0 because the CuDNN does not support the recurrent_dropout yet.
    * See the following reference for details.
        * https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM
    
* Inference_Step_Reduction
    * Setting how many steps will be exported at single step in decoder.

* Max_Step
    * Setting the maximum setp of inference mel or spectrogram While inference.

* Vocoder_Taco1
    * Setting the parameters of Griffin-Lim vocoder.

* Train
    * Setting the parameters of training.
    
* Taco_Version
    * Setting the tacotron version.
    * Currently, this hyper parameter is ignored because tacotron 1 does not implemented.
* Use_Mixed_Precision
    * Setting the usage of mixed precision.
    * If using, the tensors are stored by 16bit, not 32bit.
    * The weights are stored by 32bit, so the model is compatible with checkpoints learned with different mixed precisions if the rest of the parameters are the same.
    * Usually, this parameter makes be possible to use larger batch size.
    * In the unsupported machine, the speed is extreamly slower.
    * When using, I recommend to increase the epsilon of ADAM to 1e-4 to prevent the underflow problem.
    * See the following reference for details.
        * https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision/experimental/Policy
* Inference_Path
    * Setting the inference path
* Checkpoint_Path
    * Setting the checkpoint path
* Inference_Cut
    * The figure and wav files will be cutted at stop token when this parameter is true.
* Device
    * Setting which GPU device is used in multi-GPU enviornment.
    * Or, if using only CPU, please set '-1'.

# Run

## Command
```
python Model.py [parameters]
```

## Parameters

* -s <int>
    * Set the start step.
    * In TF2, there is no global step. However, to decay the learning rate, model require the step value.
    * Default is 0.

    
# Inference

1. Run 'ipython' in the model's directory.
2. Run following command:
```
from Model import GST_Tacotron
new_GST_Tacotron = GST_Tacotron(is_Training= False)
new_GST_Tacotron.Restore()
```
3. Set the speaker's Wav path list and text list like the following example:

```
sentence_List = [
    'The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.',
    'Strike while the iron is hot.',
    'A creative artist works on his next composition because he was not satisfied with his previous one.',
    'You cannot make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.',
    ]
wav_List_for_GST = [
    './Wav_for_Inference/FV.AWB.arctic_a0001.wav',
    './Wav_for_Inference/FV.JMK.arctic_a0004.wav',
    './Wav_for_Inference/FV.SLT.arctic_a0007.wav',
    './Wav_for_Inference/LJ.LJ050-0278.wav',
    ]
```
__※The length of wav path must be 1 or same to text list.__


4. Run following command:
```
new_GST_Tacotron.Inference(
    sentence_List = sentence_List,
    wav_List_for_GST = wav_List_for_GST,
    label = 'Result'
    )
```

# GST embedding inference
1. Do until 2 of [Inference](#Inference)

2. Set the Wav path list and tag list like the following example:
```
wav_List = [
    './Wav_for_Inference/FV.AWB.arctic_a0001.wav'
    './Wav_for_Inference/FV.JMK.arctic_a0004.wav'
    './Wav_for_Inference/FV.SLT.arctic_a0007.wav'
    './Wav_for_Inference/LJ.LJ050-0278.wav'
    ]
tag_List = [
    'AWB'
    'JMK'
    'SLT'
    'LJ'
    ]
```
__※The length of two lists must be same.__

3. Run following command:

* You can take the output as numpy arrays.

```
mels, stops, spectrograms, alignments = new_GST_Tacotron.Inference_GST(wav_List, tag_List)
```


4. The result is saved as a text file in inference directory. You can get the t-SNE analysis graph by using [R script](./R_Script/TSNE.R)


# Result
* The following results are based on the checkpoint of 36000 steps of 40 batchs (69.09 epochs).
* In figures, vertical line is stop detection.
* All speakers are distinguishable.
* Voice quality is not perfect, but I concluded that the reason is because the insufficient learning steps and the use of Griffin-Lim, not vocoder.
* I stopped training this model. I will focus to generate and attach a vocoder.

# Future works
1. Vocoder attaching. (I am focusing 'WaveGlow'.)

```

2. GST token control test
    * The GST embedding of current result is based on the mel.
    * The GST token control function is not attached yet.

2. Tacotron 1 module update
    * Original paper used the tacotron 1, not tacotron 2.
    * I hope to add tacotron 1 for performance comparison and more.
